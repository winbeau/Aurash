"""Shared upload infrastructure — reused by `/notes/files` and `/materials`.

Consolidates the upload primitives that both the writing-pane attachment
feature (`docs/plan-file-upload.md`) and the materials page
(`docs/plan-materials-integration.md`) need, so neither route hand-rolls
its own validation / disk-write logic:

- extension allowlists (doc + image) and the canonical ext→MIME table;
- a unified 50 MB cap (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`);
- an explicit deny-list (`DENY_EXTS`) for browser-executable types;
- `sniff_magic(ext, head_bytes)` — pure-stdlib magic-byte cross-check
  (no new dependency: OOXML is validated with `zipfile`);
- `save_upload(file, dest_dir)` — streaming chunked write that aborts
  *before* the bytes are fully read once `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` is exceeded
  (never `await file.read()` first);
- `safe_display_name(raw)` — strips control chars, escapes markdown
  meta-characters, truncates to 200.

`dest_dir` is always passed in by the caller so tests can monkeypatch the
target directory (each route owns its own `<sid>/...` layout).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
`/uploads` static hardening (plan §5 — done once, here documented)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The StaticFiles mount at `/uploads` (app/main.py) serves these files as
public direct links. Two defenses, both required:

  1. *Deny at upload time* — `DENY_EXTS` rejects `.svg/.html/.htm/.xml`
     so a browser can never be tricked into executing an uploaded file
     as a page/script (stored XSS). This module enforces it.

  2. *Harden the static response* — doc-class responses MUST carry
     `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (stop MIME-sniffing a payload
     into HTML) + `Content-Disposition: attachment` (force download
     rather than inline render).

     DECISION (plan §5: "二选一并在产物注释写清"): defense #2 is
     implemented at the **nginx** layer in production, NOT in the
     FastAPI StaticFiles mount. The `location /uploads/` block on
     huawei2 must add:

         location /uploads/ {
             add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
             # doc-class extensions: force download, never inline
             location ~* \\.(pdf|docx?|pptx?|xlsx?)$ {
                 add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
                 add_header Content-Disposition "attachment" always;
             }
         }

     Rationale for nginx over a custom StaticFiles subclass: the mount
     in main.py is shared by avatars/images (which we *want* inline),
     prod already terminates these requests at nginx (winbeau.top is
     served by huawei2 nginx), and keeping the header policy in nginx
     avoids per-response Python overhead. The deny-list (#1) is the
     in-app half and lives here; #2 is the ops half and is documented
     here so the PR/runbook can carry it to the prod nginx config.
