"""Pydantic schemas for the /materials/* domain.

Wire format is camelCase (see app/schemas/_base.py::CamelModel) — the
materials page is regular Aurash UGC, unlike the snake_case /schools
domain. Mirrors frontend src/api/schemas/material.ts.

The file tree is recursive: ``FileOut.children`` is a list of ``FileOut``,
so the model needs a forward reference + ``model_rebuild()`` to resolve it.
``FileOut`` instances are always built from plain Python dicts assembled by
the service's flat-SELECT grouping — **never** ``from_attributes`` mapping
of the ORM ``.children``/``.files`` relationships (those are ``lazy="raise"``
and would blow up off the event loop). See plan-materials §4.
