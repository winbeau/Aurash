"""Read-only AsyncEngine for the schools data domain.

The schools.sqlite file is produced out-of-band by supervisor-claw and
synced into ``settings.schools_data_dir`` (see
``docs/plan-schools-integration.md`` §6). This module owns a single
``SchoolsEngineHolder`` that:

* opens the SQLite file in URI ``mode=ro&immutable=1`` so we can never
  accidentally write, and so SQLite skips WAL/-shm bookkeeping (no
  ``schools.sqlite-wal`` next to the file);
* re-builds the engine when the file's mtime changes (claw re-syncs land
  via atomic rename → mtime bumps → next request sees the new bytes);
* caches the sibling ``manifest.json`` so ``/schools/meta`` can advertise
  schema_version, exported_at, etc., without re-reading on every hit.

Missing file is treated as "data not ready": ``get_engine()`` raises
``SchoolsDataMissing`` and the routes layer translates that to a 503 so
the rest of the API keeps working.
