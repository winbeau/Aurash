# Manual deploy: optionally pull main, then always sync deps / run migrations /
# restart backend / health-check.
#
# Why no early-exit on HEAD==REMOTE: it's bitten us when someone (or an agent)
# git-pull'd manually first, then ran ./deploy.sh expecting the side effects.
# uv sync + alembic upgrade + systemctl restart are all cheap & idempotent,
# so we just always run them.
#
# Flags:
#   --dry-run    check git status only; skip sync/migrate/restart/build.
#   --pull-data  ALSO refresh schools/conferences reference data from the HF
#                dataset. OFF by default: a normal deploy never touches HF (it
#                serves the existing working-tree copy). Ongoing backup of live
#                state is the sync-push cron's job, not deploy's.
